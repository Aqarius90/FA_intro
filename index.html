                                <p> <b>Welcome, comrade! The Party is overjoyed to have you with us. I can see that you are ready to charge off into action. Unfortunately, you will have to curb your enthusiasm for a bit, as our scheduled operations do not begin before <em>1920 UK time, every Sunday and Tuesday.</em> </b> </p>
                                <p>The what now?</p>
                                <p> <b>The sessions, of course! Twice a week, we will embark on a mix of Coop and PvP missions. Generally, they are affairs of 20-50 organized, focused individuals, who can be relied on to bring them to a close within 40 min, without resorting to revive or third person.</b></p>
                                <p>Oh, yeah, the sessions. What are the requirements for joining up?</p>
                                <p> <b> You will need the latest (official, stable, non beta version of) Arma 3, and (the latest stable, non beta version of) TeamSpeak 3. The Arma 3 DLC is not strictly required, but players who don't have the APEX expansion will not be able to participate in missions set on Tanoa. There are also no required addons. There is a small list of optional addons, but they are, as the name says, optional.</b></p>
                                <p> So that's for "attending". What if I want to <em>join</em>?</p>
                                <p> <b>There is no "joining" process in FA. Everyone is welcome to hop on and play. There is also no saluting, no ranks, and the slots are handed out on a 'first come-first served' basis, and you can take any slot the host calls out, be it commander, tanker, pilot, or the common grunt.</b></p>
                                <p>That's cool!</p>
                                <p> <b>Yes it is.</b></p>
                                <p>Wait, there are no ranks, but there's a commander?</p>
                                <p> <b>Exactly. Anyone can step up to command, anyone can step up to be a grunt. But whatever slot you pick for the mission, <em>stick to it</em>. If you're a rifleman, do what your unit lead tells you. If you're a unit lead, do what your commander tells you. If you're a commander, devote your time to actually commanding. ArmA works best as a team sport. Folk ARPS believes you don't need ranks to be a team.</b></p>
                                <p>But what if I screw up?</p>
                                <p> <b>Then you screw up, you laugh it off, and you do better next time. Like most other things in FA, competence is entirely optional. Your comrades will not feel less of you for trying. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purge"><em>Or else.</em></a></b></p>

                                <p><b>For starters, if you don't already have it, download <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/downloads">the latest version of TS3 from their website</a> and install it.

For the session, move to "Limbo", at the very top of the list. Next, you should probably join the game server.</b></p>
                                <p>How do I join the ArmA 3 server?</p>
                                <p><b>In the ArmA 3 Launcher that starts when you launch the game from Steam, go to SERVERS, then INTERNET, then search for 'folk' (it may take couple of minutes). Of the two servers found, select the "Folk ARPS" server and click "join". The password is "freedom".</b></p>
                                <p>The server just kicked me.</p>
                                <p><b> Yeah, that tends to happen if you have non-authorized mods. Close the game, disable any non-authorized mods (or, as a last resort, <em>all mods</em>) and try again.</b></p>
                                <p>Ok, I'm in. What now?</p>
                                <p><b>Now we wait for the host to pick a mission. Once everyone is in the Limbo channel and on the game server, the Host load up a mission and begin calling slots. For example, the Host will call for a Commander, and open the CO slot. Whoever takes the slot is the commander for the duration of the mission. Next he will call the SL, then FTL etc. Once everyone is slotted, the session Host will launch the mission, ask you to move to a different Teamspeak channel, which will be used for the duration of the mission.</b></p>
                                <p>So how do the actual missions work?</p>
                                <p><b>Once the mission is launched, you will see the briefing screen, and should move any banter to the sidechat (press '/' to type, press 'enter' to send). This gives the CO time to read the briefing and think of a plan in peace. It's a good idea to read the briefing yourself. When the CO is done planning, he will then share his plan with the rest of the platoon, and the mission will start. <s>When</s> If you get killed, return to Limbo, and once the mission ends, the Host loads the next mission, and the slotting starts again.</b></p>
                                <p>Hold on. If just anyone can join, then how do you keep out the... how to put this... more disruptive people from ruining the sessions?</p>

                                    <dd>During this phase please don't talk on TS and listen carefully to the host's instructions. Please use SideChat for questions and banter.</dd>
                                    <dt>Briefing:</dt>
                                    <dd>During this phase please don't talk on TS and listen carefully to the CO's instructions. Please use SideChat for banter. Importantly, we don't plan by committee: critiques and alternative plans belong in the session's AAR thread.</dd>
                                    <dt>In-Game:</dt>
                                    <dd>Simply remember that one person's witty banter can be another's frustrating distraction. Some banter on VON is fine, but if an element leader asks you to hush for a bit, please do so.</dd> 
                                </ul>
                                <p>That seems reasonable. What about during gameplay?</p>
                                <p><b>If you do only one thing, simply to follow the orders of your element leader and avoid lone-wolfing. Beyond that, we like to respect the design of each scenario and play the parts we have selected during slotting: unless ordered to, please don't scavenge for fancy/different weapons or vehicles not relevant to your role. Non-regulation gear tends to attract friendly fire and falling submarines.</b></p>
                                <p>What?!?</p>
                                <p><b>Nevermind. Just follow the etiquette and keep the banter to chat during planning.</b></p>
                                <p>Is, uh, is there an etiquette guide for banter?</p>
                                <p><b>Just one rule: please don't use humour that is at the expense of any group of people, be it defined by gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality, political views etc. At FA, everyone is welcome - because we all strive to ensure nobody feels unwelcome. We're sure you already know that outright sexism, racism, homophobia etc. are unacceptable here (as in many communities) - we just ask that when you crack a joke or make a witty comment, you consider first whether it will make someone feel unwelcome. If your remark boils down to 'lol, gay'/'lol, swedes'/'lol, rape', then it's just not our kind of banter. This applies not only to 'Banter' banter, but to any and all FA comms channels, be it forums, Discord, or party-approved carrier pigeons.</b></p>
                                <p>But what if me and my friend have this in-joke that s/he doesn't find offensive at all, even though it's about Swedes and Australians and sex? Isn't this all a bit Social Justice Warrior?</p>
                                <p><b>Remember that anyone can participate in our sessions - new comrades might not understand that you're friends, and may feel uncomfortable enough not to come back - which would be a shame for you, them and everyone who works hard to make the sessions happen. This isn't about politics for us, it's about ensuring that FA is a community where absolutely anyone can come and enjoy some tactical ArmA. Even sex-loving Swedes and Australians.</b></p>
                                <p>Ah ... yeah, that makes sense now that you put it that way. So what happens if someone says something that makes me uncomfortable?</p>

                                <p>Oh, well, obviously. But let's pretend for a moment that I didn't understand a word of that...</p>
                                <p><b>You'll figure it out the minute you see it in action. If you're 100% new to this, my advice would be to grab one of the 'riflemen' slots. You can even ask the host to save you one. It's a perfect position to see how the system works, and it takes no prior knowledge past "listen to your leader" and "point and shoot".</b></p>
                                <p>Right. But suppose I still wanna hear the details?</p>
                                <p><b>Allrighty then:</b></p>
